# GitHub Repository Topics Guide

This guide helps you properly tag your GitHub repositories so they appear in the correct categories on your projects page.

## Category Topics

Add these topics to your GitHub repositories to categorize them:

### Personal Projects
Add any of these topics:
- `personal`
- `portfolio`
- `own-project`

**Example use case**: Your personal website, side projects, learning projects

---

### Assignments
Add any of these topics:
- `assignment`
- `homework`
- `coursework`
- `academic`

**Example use case**: University assignments, course projects, educational work

---

### Voluntary / Open Source
Add any of these topics:
- `voluntary`
- `volunteer`
- `opensource`
- `open-source`
- `contribution`

**Example use case**: Open source contributions, volunteer work, community projects

---

### Client Work
Add any of these topics:
- `client`
- `client-work`
- `client-project`
- `freelance`
- `commissioned`

**Example use case**: Freelance projects, work for clients, commissioned work

---

### Public Release
Add any of these topics:

## How to Add Topics to a Repository

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. In the "About" section (right sidebar), click the ⚙️ gear icon
3. In the "Topics" field, type the relevant topic and press Enter
4. Add multiple topics if needed
5. Click "Save changes"

## Tips

- **Use multiple topics**: You can add multiple topics to describe your project better
- **First match wins**: If a repository has topics from multiple categories, it will be placed in the first matching category (in this order: Personal → Assignments → Voluntary → Client Work → Public Release)
- **Be consistent**: Try to use the same topics across similar projects
- **Additional topics**: Feel free to add other descriptive topics (e.g., `react`, `typescript`, `nextjs`) - they won't affect categorization but will be displayed on the project cards

## Example Repository Topic Setup

### Personal Portfolio Website
Topics: `personal`, `portfolio`, `nextjs`, `typescript`, `react`

### University Data Structures Assignment
Topics: `assignment`, `academic`, `data-structures`, `java`

### Open Source Contribution to React
Topics: `opensource`, `contribution`, `react`, `javascript`

### Client E-commerce Website
Topics: `client`, `freelance`, `ecommerce`, `nextjs`

### Public NPM Package
Topics: `public-release`, `library`, `npm`, `typescript`, `utility`

## Uncategorized Projects

Repositories without any categorization topics will appear in the "Uncategorized" category. This is fine for:
- Experimental projects
- Forks
- Template repositories
- Projects in early development
